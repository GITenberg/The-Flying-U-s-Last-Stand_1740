description: When a young lady from a land boom syndicate tries to enlist Andy Green's
  help in a scheme to lure settlers to Montana, he isn't interested- - until he learns
  that the land selected was part of the Flying U Ranch. Andy quickly sets off to
  tell Chip Bennett and the rest of the Happy Family at the Flying U about the insidious
  plot that could sound the death knell for the Flying U. This exhilarating episode
  joins the family and friends of the Flying U Ranch as they make an end-run around
  land-grabbers, while dealing with a stampede, a prairie fire, and the disappearance
  of Chip Bennet's six-year-old son.
